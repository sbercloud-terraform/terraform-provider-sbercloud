# sbercloud\_obs\_bucket

Provides an OBS bucket resource.

## Example Usage

### Private Bucket with Tags

```hcl
resource "sbercloud_obs_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    foo = "bar"
    Env = "Test"
  }
}
```

### Enable versioning

```hcl
resource "sbercloud_obs_bucket" "b" {
  bucket     = "my-tf-test-bucket"
  acl        = "private"
  versioning = true
}
```

### Enable Logging

```hcl
resource "sbercloud_obs_bucket" "log_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-tf-log-bucket"
  acl    = "log-delivery-write"
}

resource "sbercloud_obs_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  logging {
    target_bucket = sbercloud_obs_bucket.log_bucket.id
    target_prefix = "log/"
  }
}
```

### Static Website Hosting

```hcl
resource "sbercloud_obs_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "obs-website-test.hashicorp.com"
  acl    = "public-read"

  website {
    index_document = "index.html"
    error_document = "error.html"

    routing_rules = <<EOF
[{
    "Condition": {
        "KeyPrefixEquals": "docs/"
    },
    "Redirect": {
        "ReplaceKeyPrefixWith": "documents/"
    }
}]
EOF
  }
}
```

### Using CORS

```hcl
resource "sbercloud_obs_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "obs-website-test.hashicorp.com"
  acl    = "public-read"

  cors_rule {
    allowed_origins = ["https://obs-website-test.hashicorp.com"]
    allowed_methods = ["PUT", "POST"]
    allowed_headers = ["*"]
    expose_headers  = ["ETag"]
    max_age_seconds = 3000
  }
}
```

### Using object lifecycle

```hcl
resource "sbercloud_obs_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket     = "my-bucket"
  acl        = "private"
  versioning = true

  lifecycle_rule {
    name    = "log"
    prefix  = "log/"
    enabled = true

    expiration {
      days = 365
    }
    transition {
      days = 60
      storage_class = "WARM"
    }
    transition {
      days = 180
      storage_class = "COLD"
    }
  }

  lifecycle_rule {
    name    = "tmp"
    prefix  = "tmp/"
    enabled = true

    noncurrent_version_expiration {
      days = 180
    }
    noncurrent_version_transition {
      days = 30
      storage_class = "WARM"
    }
    noncurrent_version_transition {
      days = 60
      storage_class = "COLD"
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `bucket` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the name of the bucket. Changing this parameter will create a new resource.
  A bucket must be named according to the globally applied DNS naming regulations as follows:
	* The name must be globally unique in OBS.
	* The name must contain 3 to 63 characters. Only lowercase letters, digits, hyphens (-), and periods (.) are allowed.
	* The name cannot start or end with a period (.) or hyphen (-), and cannot contain two consecutive periods (.) or contain a period (.) and a hyphen (-) adjacent to each other.
	* The name cannot be an IP address.
	* If the name contains any periods (.), a security certificate verification message may appear when you access the bucket or its objects by entering a domain name.

* `storage_class` - (Optional, String) Specifies the storage class of the bucket. OBS provides three storage classes: "STANDARD", "WARM" (Infrequent Access) and "COLD" (Archive). Defaults to `STANDARD`.

* `acl` - (Optional, String) Specifies the ACL policy for a bucket. The predefined common policies are as follows: "private", "public-read", "public-read-write" and "log-delivery-write". Defaults to `private`.

* `policy` - (Optional, String) Specifies the text of the bucket policy in JSON format. For more information about
  obs format bucket policy, see the [Developer Guide](https://support.hc.sbercloud.ru/api/obs/obs_04_0027.html).

* `policy_format` - (Optional, String) Specifies the policy format, the supported values are *obs* and *s3*. Defaults to *obs*.

* `tags` - (Optional, Map) A mapping of tags to assign to the bucket. Each tag is represented by one key-value pair.

* `versioning` - (Optional, Bool) Whether enable versioning. Once you version-enable a bucket, it can never return to an unversioned state.
  You can, however, suspend versioning on that bucket.

* `logging` - (Optional, Map) A settings of bucket logging (documented below).

* `quota` - (Optional, Int) Specifies bucket storage quota. Must be a positive integer in the unit of byte. The maximum storage quota is 2<sup>63</sup> â€“ 1 bytes. The default bucket storage quota is 0, indicating that the bucket storage quota is not limited.

* `website` - (Optional, List) A website object (documented below).
* `cors_rule` - (Optional, List) A rule of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (documented below).
* `lifecycle_rule` - (Optional, List) A configuration of object lifecycle management (documented below).

* `force_destroy` - (Optional, Bool) A boolean that indicates all objects should be deleted from the bucket so that the bucket can be destroyed without error. Default to `false`.

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specified the region where this bucket will be created. If not specified, used the region by the provider.

* `parallel_fs` - (Optional, Bool, ForceNew) Whether enable a bucket as a parallel file system. Changing this will
  create a new bucket.

* `multi_az` - (Optional, Bool, ForceNew) Whether enable the multi-AZ mode for the bucket. When the multi-AZ mode is
  enabled, data in the bucket is duplicated and stored in multiple AZs.

  -> **NOTE:** Once a bucket is created, you cannot enable or disable the multi-AZ mode. Changing this will create a new
  bucket, but the name of a deleted bucket can be reused for another bucket at least 30 minutes after the deletion.
  Exercise caution when changing this field.

* `encryption` - (Optional, Bool) Whether enable default server-side encryption of the bucket in SSE-KMS mode.

* `kms_key_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the ID of a KMS key. If omitted, the default master key will be used.

* `kms_key_project_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the project ID to which the KMS key belongs. If omitted, the ID
  of the provider-level project will be used.

* `enterprise_project_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The enterprise project id of the OBS bucket. Changing this creates a OBS bucket.

The `logging` object supports the following:

* `target_bucket` - (Required, String) The name of the bucket that will receive the log objects.
  The acl policy of the target bucket should be `log-delivery-write`.
* `target_prefix` - (Optional, String) To specify a key prefix for log objects.

The `website` object supports the following:

* `index_document` - (Required, String)  Unless using `redirect_all_requests_to`. Specifies the default homepage of the static website, only HTML web pages are supported.
  OBS only allows files such as `index.html` in the root directory of a bucket to function as the default homepage.
  That is to say, do not set the default homepage with a multi-level directory structure (for example, /page/index.html).

* `error_document` - (Optional, String) Specifies the error page returned when an error occurs during static website access.
  Only HTML, JPG, PNG, BMP, and WEBP files under the root directory are supported.

* `redirect_all_requests_to` - (Optional, String) A hostname to redirect all website requests for this bucket to. Hostname can optionally be prefixed with a protocol (`http://` or `https://`) to use when redirecting requests. The default is the protocol that is used in the original request.

* `routing_rules` - (Optional, String) A JSON or XML format containing routing rules describing redirect behavior and when redirects are applied.
  Each rule contains a `Condition` and a `Redirect` as shown in the following table:

  Parameter | Key
      --- | ---
  Condition | KeyPrefixEquals, HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals
  Redirect | Protocol, HostName, ReplaceKeyPrefixWith, ReplaceKeyWith, HttpRedirectCode
