}

resource "sbercloud_dws_cluster" "cluster" {
  node_type         = "dws.m3.xlarge"
  number_of_node    = 3
  network_id        = "{{ network_id }}"
  vpc_id            = "{{ vpc_id }}"
  security_group_id = sbercloud_networking_secgroup.secgroup.id
  availability_zone = "{{ availability_zone }}"
  name              = "terraform_dws_cluster_test"
