# sbercloud\_ges\_graph

GES graph management

## Example Usage

### create an empty graph

```hcl
resource "sbercloud_networking_secgroup" "secgroup" {
  name        = "terraform_test_security_group"
  description = "terraform security group acceptance test"
}

resource "sbercloud_ges_graph" "graph" {
  availability_zone = "{{ availability_zone }}"
  graph_size_type   = 0
  name              = "terraform_ges_graph_test"
  region            = "{{ region_name }}"
  security_group_id = sbercloud_networking_secgroup.secgroup.id
  subnet_id         = "{{ network_id }}"
  vpc_id            = "{{ vpc_id }}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `availability_zone` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Indicates availability zone.  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `graph_size_type` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Indicates the graph size type.   0: indicates 10 thousand edges.   1:
  indicates 1 million edges.   2: indicates 10 million edges.   3:
  indicates 100 million edges.   4: indicates 1 billion edges.   5:
  indicates 10 billion edges.   6: indicates 100 billion edges.  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `name` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Indicates the graph name.  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `region` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Indicates the region code.  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `security_group_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Indicates the security group ID.  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `subnet_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Indicates the subnet ID in the specified VPC.  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `vpc_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Indicates the VPC ID.  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `auto_assign` - (Optional, Bool, ForceNew) Indicates whether to assign a new eip to the graph automatically.  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `eip_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Indicates the ID of an EIP.  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - Specifies a resource ID in UUID format.

* `created` - Indicates the time when a graph is created.

* `edgeset_path` - Indicates the OBS path of the edge data set. Structure is documented below.

* `private_ip` - Indicates the private network access address of a graph instance.
  Users can access the instance using the IP address through the ECS
  deployed on the private network.

* `public_ip` - Indicates the public network access address of a graph instance.
  Users can access the instance using the IP address from the Internet.

* `schema_path` - Indicates the path for storing the metadata file. Structure is documented below.

* `version` - Indicates the graph version.

* `vertexset_path` - Indicates the OBS path of the vertex data set. Structure is documented below.

The `edgeset_path` block contains:

* `path` - Indicates the OBS storage path, excluding OBS endpoint.

* `status` - Indicates the OBS file import status:   success: Imported
  successfully.   partiallyFailed: Partially failed.   failed:
  Failed to import the file.

The `schema_path` block contains:

* `path` - Indicates the OBS storage path, excluding OBS endpoint.

* `status` - Indicates the OBS file import status:
success: Imported successfully. partiallyFailed: Partially failed. failed: Failed to import the file.

The `vertexset_path` block contains:

* `path` - Indicates the OBS storage path, excluding OBS endpoint.

* `status` - Indicates the OBS file import status:
success: Imported successfully. partiallyFailed: Partially failed. failed: Failed to import the file.
