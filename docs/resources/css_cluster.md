CSS cluster management

## Example Usage

### create a cluster

```hcl
resource "sbercloud_networking_secgroup" "secgroup" {
  name        = "terraform_test_security_group"
  description = "terraform security group acceptance test"
}

resource "sbercloud_css_cluster" "cluster" {
  expect_node_num = 1
  name            = "terraform_test_cluster"
  engine_version  = "7.1.1"

  node_config {
    flavor = "ess.spec-4u16g"
    network_info {
      security_group_id = sbercloud_networking_secgroup.secgroup.id
      subnet_id         = "{{ network_id }}"
      vpc_id            = "{{ vpc_id }}"
    }
    volume {
      volume_type = "HIGH"
      size        = 40
    }
    availability_zone = "{{ availability_zone }}"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The region in which to create the cluster resource. If omitted, the provider-level region will be used. Changing this creates a new cluster resource.

* `name` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Cluster name. It contains 4 to 32 characters. Only letters, digits,
  hyphens (-), and underscores (_) are allowed. The value must start
  with a letter. Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `engine_type` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Engine type. The default value is "elasticsearch". Currently, the value
  can only be "elasticsearch". Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `engine_version` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Engine version. Versions 5.5.1, 6.2.3, 6.5.4, 7.1.1 and 7.6.2 are supported. Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `expect_node_num` - (Optional, Int) Number of cluster instances. The value range is 1 to 32. Defaults to 1.

* `security_mode` - (Optional, Bool, ForceNew) Whether to enable communication encryption and security authentication.
  Available values include *true* and *false*. security_mode is disabled by default.
  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `password` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Password of the cluster administrator admin in security mode.
  This parameter is mandatory only when security_mode is set to true. Changing this parameter will create a new resource.
  The administrator password must meet the following requirements:
  - The password can contain 8 to 32 characters.
  - The password must contain at least 3 of the following character types: uppercase letters, lowercase letters,
    digits, and special characters (~!@#$%^&*()-_=+\\|[{}];:,<.>/?).

* `node_config` - (Required, List, ForceNew) Node configuration. Structure is documented below. Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `backup_strategy` - (Optional, List) Specifies the advanced backup policy. Structure is documented below.

* `tags` - (Optional, Map) The key/value pairs to associate with the cluster.

The `node_config` block supports:

* `availability_zone` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Availability zone (AZ).  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `flavor` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Instance flavor name. For example: value range of flavor ess.spec-2u8g:
  40 GB to 800 GB, value range of flavor ess.spec-4u16g: 40 GB to 1600 GB,
  value range of flavor ess.spec-8u32g: 80 GB to 3200 GB, value range of
  flavor ess.spec-16u64g: 100 GB to 6400 GB, value range of
  flavor ess.spec-32u128g: 100 GB to 10240 GB.
  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `network_info` - (Required, List, ForceNew) Network information. Structure is documented below. Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `volume` - (Required, List, ForceNew) Information about the volume. Structure is documented below. Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

The `network_info` block supports:

* `vpc_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) VPC ID, which is used for configuring cluster network. Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `subnet_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Subnet ID. All instances in a cluster must have the same subnet which should be configured with a *DNS address*.
  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `security_group_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Security group ID. All instances in a cluster must have the same security group.
  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

The `volume` block supports:

* `size` - (Required, Int) Specifies the volume size in GB, which must be a multiple of 10.

* `volume_type` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the volume type. COMMON: Common I/O. The SATA disk is used. HIGH: High I/O.
  The SAS disk is used. ULTRAHIGH: Ultra-high I/O. The
  solid-state drive (SSD) is used. Changing this parameter will create a new resource.


The `backup_strategy` block supports:

* `start_time` - (Required, String) Specifies the time when a snapshot is automatically
  created everyday. Snapshots can only be created on the hour. The time format is
  the time followed by the time zone, specifically, **HH:mm z**. In the format, HH:mm
  refers to the hour time and z refers to the time zone. For example, "00:00 GMT+08:00"
  and "01:00 GMT+08:00".

* `keep_days` - (Optional, Int) Specifies the number of days to retain the generated
   snapshots. Snapshots are reserved for seven days by default.
